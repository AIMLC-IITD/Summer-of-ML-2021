### Instructor: [Pramit Das](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pramit-das-b1747054/)

In this workshop, we will be covering basic concepts related to the mathematics involved in Machine Learning. 

In the first part, we plan to learn the fundamental uses of Eigen values, matrix factorization and how we use those notions in ML. 
In the second part, we intend to go over some basic statistical distributions and a very simple yet useful technique called Naive Bayes Classification.
