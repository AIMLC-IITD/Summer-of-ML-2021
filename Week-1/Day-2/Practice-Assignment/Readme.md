# AIMLC-Assignment1

In this assignment we're going to use information like a person's age, sex, BMI, no. of children and smoking habit to predict the price of yearly medical bills. This kind of model is useful for insurance companies to determine the yearly insurance premium for a person. The dataset for this problem is taken from Kaggle [link](https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance).

We will create a model with the following steps:

1. Download and explore the dataset
2. Prepare the dataset for training
3. Create a linear regression model
4. Train the model to fit the data
5. Make predictions using the trained model


This assignment builds upon the concepts from the first 2 lessons. It will help to review these Jupyter notebooks:

1. PyTorch basics: https://jovian.ai/aakashns/01-pytorch-basics
2. Linear Regression: https://jovian.ai/aakashns/02-linear-regression
3. Logistic Regression: https://jovian.ai/aakashns/03-logistic-regression
4. Linear regression (minimal): https://jovian.ai/aakashns/housing-linear-minimal
5. Logistic regression (minimal): https://jovian.ai/aakashns/mnist-logistic-minimal


As you go through this notebook, you will find a **???** in certain places. Your job is to replace the **???** with appropriate code or values, to ensure that the notebook runs properly end-to-end . In some cases, you'll be required to choose some hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size etc.). Try to experiment with the hypeparameters to get the lowest loss
